# Full Stack Project Practice

Be prepared to discuss these items with a consultant during a 1 on 1.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

```md

-A drug prescription app(stores the prescription and the drug info)
-I've thought about this app idea when I personally experienced how impossible it is
to remember the names of the meds/when did I get it/refill?/dr's name?/description/etc.
-Any patients who get prescriptions from a doctor

```

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

```md
-User can sign up/sign in/sign out/change pw
-User can create(add) a record of a prescription
-User can see all the prescriptions that are stored
-User can update the prescriptions(log side effects, likes/dislikes)
-User can delete(archieve) the prescriptions
```

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Plan your resources

What resources will you need? What will the attributes and relationships be?

```md

resources: user, prescription
User attributes: firstName, lastName, DOB
Prescription attributes: drugName, description, orderBy(dr's name), date, refills?

```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your resources are related to one another
(one to many, many to many, etc).

Include an image (or a link to image) below.

```md

One to many relationship: a user to many prescriptions.

```

## Routing

What routes will you need to make the proper request to your API?

```md

user routes
prescription routes

```

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

```md
Day 1 - Setting up repos, READme, consulting with instructor, pseudo code, start working on userSchema
Day 2 - Working on user - server.js/model/user routes/curl scripts
Day 3 - Working on prescription - server.js/model/prescription routes/curl scripts
Day 4 - Finishing up Working on front end

```
